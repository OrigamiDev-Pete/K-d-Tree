## Building
To build the project you will need the latest version of [Zig (v0.11.0)](https://ziglang.org/download/). Once Zig is install, simply run:
```sh
zig build
```
This produces an executable in the `zig-out/bin` directory.

You can also immediately run the built executable by running:
```sh
zig build run
```
The program itself doesn't produce any interesting outputs, but will create a tree, perform some operations, then exit. Refer to the tests for more thourough coverage.

## Tests
Zig has a built in testing framework. To invoke the tests for this project, run:
```sh
zig test ./src/main.zig # Adjust the path as necessary
```
All being well, the output should say, `All 10 tests passed`.
